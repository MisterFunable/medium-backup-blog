# Part 1 - Designing a Mascot/Logo: My Journey With AI Image Generation

With the release of **Nanobana Pro**, I wanted to see how far I could push my little creative experiments. So far, it's been surprisingly great for generating the character I now use for my personal website and, of course, these posts.

This article is basically a _love letter_ to my mascot, **Undefined-chan**, and everything I've learned while trying to give her a consistent digital life.

Tech often lacks cuteness, which is exactly why I lean into it. A character makes things prettier and way less boring, and, let's be honest, I'm too lazy to draw something that's basically complementary to the real work.

I wanted a mascot... I just don't want to spend five hours doing line art.

## The Beginning

Back when I was still debating whether starting a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MisterFunable) was worth it, I played with a couple ideas of how the whole "brand" should look.

The original plan? A **redhead retro pilot girl**, because that aesthetic is closer to mechas than anything else.

I also imagined a reddish color scheme, basically the total opposite of what I use in my videos now (green has completely taken over).

To make it more fun, I'll include the image of the generated logo +

### First Iteration: ChatGPT

> **Prompt**: Retro girl pilot mech style, red hair, cute (+ $MANY_DETAILS_THAT_WILL_BE_IGNORED)

Getting the colors even halfway correct felt like a huge win. Asking for small adjustments, though, was pure trial and error, and "error" won most rounds.

Unfortunately, even when I liked this logo, it didn't look good at small sizes. Too many details vanished when scaled down. Which led me to the next iteration, something more minimalist.

### Second Iteration: Artlist

I changed the logo at around **40 subscribers**. Yes, popularity is hard. Please respect my struggle 😂

That was around the time when AI models started getting more consistent, so I experimented with a few options, including [Artlist](https://artlist.io/). I'm not 100% sure that's what I used back then (it was about a year ago), but I remember making several changes through it.

Amid the chaos of saving multiple copies and trying to rerun edits, I ended up with this:

![_Logo (ChatGPT+Artlist) and Sketch (Nanobanana Pro)_](/medium-backup-blog/medium-assets/13/img-06.png)

It was still hit-or-miss, but at least most edits applied consistently. That alone felt magical.

**The downside**: the **free tier** was limiting, and I didn't have enough reasons to commit to a full plan at the time.

At this point I made new iterations over the original logo which led for the current Undefined-chan.

Hopefully I won't take a month to publish the next part, but I'll leave space below for the upcoming entries:

- Part 2: Proto Undefined-chan and Nanobanana

- Part 3: Other Models and NSFW

And to close this first part... a meme:
