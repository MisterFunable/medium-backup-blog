# Substack as a Medium Alternative

Not big enough to worry about reach, but accessibility is one thing I want

I had on my backlog having an alternative to share posts without having to make a Medium account to read them, not to mention other restrictions like the number of stories. So while reading, I saw two approaches to this issue:

- **Paid tiers**: The writer provides a Friend link that allows you to read the post for free.

- **Substack alternative**: The Writer provides a link to Substack where it's the same post with almost the same features.

Another option I was working on is having your posts on a dedicated site by extracting them from Medium through the [RapidAPI](https://mediumapi.com/).

The [Repository](https://github.com/MisterFunable/medium-backup-blog/tree/main) has everything to run, there are free API calls per month, so it's quite useful. [Here](https://medium.com/@funable/backing-up-my-medium-posts-4fa884d9c138) is the post explaining how to run it.

The problem with this approach is that you have to maintain the site, maybe buy a nice domain, so even with AI tools it's extra work. I'll keep it since I like having backups more than ever (Thanks YouTube). That also reminds me, I made an n8n workflow to backup Instagram videos.

Going back to Substack...

I made an account at the beginning of the year, but when trying to copy-paste the content, things went south.

Fast forward to today: I saw there was an API for Substack, and since I'm already backing up posts... I could do a cool workflow that uploads them after doing the backup.

And that's my current adventure. I requested access to the API, so we'll see how it plays out.

Still, Medium will be my main platform since it's comfortable and I haven't found a way to put multiple images in line in, or I haven't tried hard enough on Substack, but time will tell.

Peace!
