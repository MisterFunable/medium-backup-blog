# Metal Build Compatible Accessories: The Third-Party Revolution

I've been noticing an explosion of third-party products compatible with Metal Build figures lately - backpacks, weapons, display bases, and more. There's so much out there that it's impossible to buy everything (though I'd love to try). Instead, I'm curating a list of products that caught my eye and asking the community: has anyone tried these?

Let me walk you through what I've found.

> **Quick note on pricing:** All prices mentioned are based on AliExpress listings and may vary depending on your region, seller, and current promotions. If you know other reliable sources for these products, drop them in the comments!

## Metal Build Base Platform

This is something I didn't know I needed until I saw it. The standard MG bases? They look awful. These alternatives come in two flavors:

**Standard Support** (~$7 USD)

**Metal Build Support** (~$10 USD)

There are multiple models available, but for consistency, I'd go with the Metal Build style. My main question: is the quality consistent across both options? That would help me decide which one to invest in.

## COMIC CLUB QIANQU SHANG

Over the past year, I've seen more and more products from this brand. Here are the standouts:

### Chuxia Spear Battleaxe

Ever dreamed of owning the Metal Build Astray Red Dragonics but can't stomach the price? If you've already invested in three expensive wing sets, this battleaxe lets you replicate the Dragonics wings at a fraction of the cost.

I actually bought this one - it's quite cool. You might need to add something to tighten the connections, but out of the box, it works great with Metal Build figures.

### Hyper Mega Launcher

At around $30 USD, this costs about 1/5th the price of the current Metal Build Hi-Nu Gundam Hyper Mega Launcher bazooka. Plus, it has lights! I'm not sure if the MB version has lighting, but I doubt it.

(Note to self: I really should learn Chinese to better research these products...)

## SENGOKU RED Astray EXPANSION SET for HIRM MG 1/100

This set costs around $30 USD, and I'm hoping it works with Metal Build figures. I'm particularly interested in the head piece, but my concern is buying accessories that end up being incompatible. The risk of wasting money outweighs just making the purchase.

**Community question:** Can someone please try this and report back?

On the plus side, you can also buy four swords in various colors for about $10 USD, which seems like a solid deal.

## DL MODEL DECAL

### 1/100 MG Shadow Cloak Type II Pack Accessories for HIRM MB Astray Frame (DL80005A/B)

This one's a bit mysterious - I can't find complete information, but it explicitly says "MB" in the description, so I'm about 90% confident it's compatible. Available in two colors for around $30 USD.

I tried using a translator but couldn't get clear results from the product description. However, seeing "MB" in the listing gives me hope.

*I believe buying the complete pack is cheaper than purchasing items individually.*

### Sword and Launcher Pack for MG MB 1/100 Eclipse Strike Astray Buster Blitz Model (DD108)

Priced at around $40 USD, this looks promising - especially when you consider the Metal Build equivalent costs around $200 USD. Yes, the official quality is worth it, but at these price differences, some customization and DIY work might be the smarter route.

### Eclipse Backpack Parts for MG 1/100 Astray Frame Strike Freedom SEED Buster Mobile Suit Model

Around $25 USD. This looks remarkably similar to the Metal Build Strike, so I'd estimate 99% compatibility. The connectors also appear compatible with Metal Build Astrays, making this a versatile purchase.

## Final Thoughts

The third-party Metal Build accessory market is booming, and while it's exciting, it's also overwhelming. The biggest challenge is verifying compatibility before dropping cash on products that might not work.

If you've tried any of these accessories - or have recommendations for others - please share your experience in the comments. Let's help each other navigate this expanding ecosystem without breaking the bank on incompatible gear.

Until next time, happy customizing!
